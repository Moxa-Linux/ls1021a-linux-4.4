Intersil ISL1208, ISL1218 I2C RTC/Alarm chip

ISL1208 is a trivial I2C device (it has simple device tree bindings,
consisting of a compatible field, an address and possibly an interrupt
line).

Required properties supported by the device:

 - "compatible": must be one of
	"isil,isl1208"
	"isil,isl1218"
 - "reg": I2C bus address of the device

Optional properties:

 - "interrupt-parent", "interrupts", "interrupts-extended":
   for passing the interrupt line of the SoC connected to #IRQ pin
   of the RTC chip.


Example isl1208 node without #IRQ pin connected:

	isl1208: isl1208@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl1208";
		reg = <0x68>;
	};

Example isl1208 node with #IRQ pin connected to SoC gpio1 pin 12:

	isl1208: isl1208@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl1208";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <12 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	};
